The GAMtools API
================

GAMtools provides a programmatic python API for working with GAM data. The
key modules of interest for third-party developers are:

- gamtools.call_windows: functions for identifying positive windows in NPs
- gamtools.cosegregation: functions for estimating proximity between genomic regions
- gamtools.matrix: functions for reading/writing GAM matrices
- gamtools.segregation: functions for dealing with segregation tables (GAM datasets)
